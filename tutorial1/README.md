# Creating a CUmulus Instance

Today we're going to go cover: 
1) Cumulus Access 
	- Getting access to Cumulus and the allocation process
	- Logging into Horizon (Cumulus web portal)
	- Creation of an instance (i.e. virtual machine) within a demo VPC
	- Logging into your instance via ssh 
2) Demo a workflow one might use Cumulus for: 
	- Query Twitter via the Twitter API and store data into a MySQL database (using docker containers).
